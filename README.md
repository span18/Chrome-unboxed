# Chrome-unboxed


-Accessing

You can access my website via https://span18.github.io/Chrome-unboxed/

-The project

This project was to copy the google chrome box website

-Technologies

I worked with html, css & javascript,

-Testing

Tested on chrome, firefox, IE & microsoft edge. Also tested on android mobile.

-Git

I decided to work on the master branch since I was the only one involved in this project. Otherwise I would have switched to using branches for any updates

-Improvements. There are still improvments I am looking to finish. These are as follows:

I am unable to adjust the height of the col-40 class as this adjusts to fit the specific amount requested within the contaning element and I have not found a way to adjust the height to fit the container.
